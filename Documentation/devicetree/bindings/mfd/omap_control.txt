* Texas Instrument OMAP System Control Module (SCM) bindings

The control module allows software control of various static modes supported by
the device. The control module controls the settings of various device  modules
through register configuration and internal signals. It also controls  the  pad
configuration, pin functional multiplexing, and the routing of internal signals
(such as PRCM  signals or DMA requests)  to output pins configured for hardware
observability.

Required properties:
- compatible : Should be:
  - "ti,omap3-control" for OMAP3 support
  - "ti,omap4-control" for OMAP4 support
  - "ti,omap5-control" for OMAP5 support

OMAP specific properties:
- ti,hwmods: Name of the hwmod associated to the control module:
  Should be "ctrl_module_core";

Sub-nodes:
- bandgap : contains the bandgap node

  The bindings details of individual bandgap device can be found in:
  Documentation/devicetree/bindings/thermal/omap_bandgap.txt

- usb : contains the usb phy pin control node

  The only required property for this child is:
    - compatible = "ti,omap4-control-usb";

Examples:

ctrl_module_core: ctrl_module_core@4a002000 {
	compatible = "ti,omap4-control";
	ti,hwmods = "ctrl_module_core";
	bandgap {
		compatible = "ti,omap4460-bandgap";
		interrupts = <0 126 4>; /* talert */
		ti,tshut-gpio = <86>; /* tshut */
	};
	usb {
		compatible = "ti,omap4-usb-phy";
	};
};
