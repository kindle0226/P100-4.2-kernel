	depends on (ARCH_OMAP3 || ARCH_OMAP4 || ARCH_OMAP5)
	default n
	---help---
	  If you say Y here, you will enable the OMAP HSI hardware driver.

	  Note: This module is a unified driver specific to OMAP. Efforts are
	  underway to create a vendor independent implementation.

	  The MIPI HSI is a High Speed Synchronous Serial Interface and is
	  defined for communication between two Integrated Circuits (the
	  typical scenario is an application IC and cellular modem IC
	  communication). Data transaction model is peer-to-peer.

	  Not all features required for a production device are implemented in
	  this driver. See the documentation for more information.

	  This physical layer provides logical channeling and several modes of
	  operation.

	  The OMAP HSI driver supports either:
	    - the OMAP MIPI HSI device
	    - the OMAP SSI device

	default OMAP_HSI_DEVICE
	---help---
	  Adds the device support for one of the devices handled by the HSI
	  driver.

	  The OMAP HSI driver supports either:
	    - the OMAP MIPI HSI device
	    - the OMAP SSI device

config OMAP_HSI_DEVICE
	bool "HSI (OMAP MIPI HSI)"
	depends on (ARCH_OMAP4 || ARCH_OMAP5)
	---help---
	  The MIPI High Speed Synchronous Serial Interface (HSI) is a high
	  speed communication interface that is used for connecting OMAP
	  to another IC.

	  The MIPI HSI support is mainly selected by the OMAP architecture
	  version.
	  For more details, refer to the documentation.

config OMAP_SSI_DEVICE
	bool "SSI (OMAP SSI)"
	depends on ARCH_OMAP3
	---help---
	  Synchronous Serial Interface (SSI) is a high speed communication
	  interface that is used for connecting OMAP to another IC.

	  The SSI support is mainly selected by the OMAP architecture
	  version.

config OMAP_HSI_CHAR
	tristate "OMAP HSI character driver"
	depends on OMAP_HSI
	---help---
	  If you say Y here, you will enable the OMAP HSI character driver.

	  This driver provides a simple character device interface for
	  serial communication over the HSI bus.
	  It can be compiled as a module.
